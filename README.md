# delta-analytics
Shared repository for OMF / Delta Analytics work on Open.Media, visualizing government meeting data


## TO DO

* Weird bug where when session listing loads, the analytics graph populated with true data disappears. This is because the session analytics object in state is being overwritten seemingly?! Not sure how! Must be the way I hooked up the effects. I think this should be fixable pre-demo.
* Hook up Metrics to session analytics (related to above).
* Hook up first graph to session analytics.
